00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,600
Ah, Bernard,
how is our great statesman this afternoon?

2
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,120
- Very cheerful.
- What has he found to be cheerful about?

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,280
- Well, at Question Time he did very well.
- In whose opinion?

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,880
Everyone was impressed with his answer
on tapping MPs' phones.

5
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,680
- I heard about that, but regrettably not from you.
- I didn't see any point.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,720
I coordinate all government security.
Why was the question not referred to me first?

7
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,440
- It was an unforeseen supplementary.
- A foreseeable unforeseen supplementary.

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,600
It was a good answer. "Much as I respect
and value the opinions of this house,

9
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,520
"I have no desire to listen to honourable members
for any longer than I have to." Got a good laugh.

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,040
- From you.
- Yes, and from his own party.

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,200
Ones hoping to be promoted
or afraid of being sacked?

12
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,760
That's just about all of them.

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,440
I gather he denied that he'd authorised
the bugging of an MP's phone.

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,480
Well, yes. Well, he hasn't, has he?
Has he? He has? Crikey!

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,680
It's all here, Bernard, including the transcripts.
Shall we... um...

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Can't we wait? He doesn't get many moments
of unalloyed pleasure.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I suppose he gets all he deserves.

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,120
- Prime Minister.
- Ah, come in!

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,680
- I want to talk about PM's Question Time.
- I accept your congratulations!

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,440
- Wasn't I brilliant? Didn't you think so?
- Well, I wasn't there, but...

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
- Wasn't I brilliant, Bernard?
- Er...

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,960
- Your replies will not be quickly forgotten.
- Let me tell you what happened.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,920
The first question was about that cock-up over
the shortage of prison officers. Masterly reply!

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,560
I said, "I refer the honourable member
to the speech I made on October 28th."

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,320
- Did he remember what you'd said?
- No.

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,680
Neither did I, come to that. Still, it shut him up.

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,120
The next one was, "Did the Department
of Employment fiddle the figures?"

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,240
Restructure the base from which the statistics
have been derived without telling the public?

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,080
- Exactly. Fiddle the figures.
- Of course they do.

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,000
I know they do.
I said I'd found no significant evidence of it.

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,360
- You haven't looked.
- And we haven't shown you.

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Well done. Then we went on to a googly about
the Dept of Energy's plans for nuclear waste.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
- He wanted me to admit Cabinet was divided.
- Well, it is.

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,760
I know. So I said,
"My cabinet took a unanimous decision."

35
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,320
You threatened to dismiss anyone
who wouldn't agree.

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,480
It certainly made them agree unanimously.

37
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,480
My back benchers were cheering my every word.

38
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,360
Oh, yes, then we had a question
about why our new anti-missile missile

39
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,560
was scrapped as obsolete
the day before it came off the production line.

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,120
- And how did you wriggle out of that one?
- That was my masterstroke!

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
My reply was sheer genius.

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,120
I said our policy had not been as effective
as we'd hoped. Clearly we had got it wrong.

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,280
- You admitted that?
- Yeah. Brilliant!

44
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,040
Took the wind right out of his sails!

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,280
Honesty always gives you the advantage
of surprise in the House of Commons.

46
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,080
The PM was also asked when he would request
the resignation from the responsible minister.

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,240
I said, "When he makes a mistake
that could've been seen at the time

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,600
"and not with the benefit of hindsight."

49
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,440
They were on their feet cheering, stamping,
waving their order papers!

50
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,520
I gather there was a question
about the bugging of an MP's phone.

51
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,440
- Yes, I got a terrific laugh with that. I said...
- Bernard told me.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,440
- I said, "Much as I respect..."
- Bernard told me.

53
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,360
Oh. Well, anyway, that was stupid.
Why should we bug Hugh Halifax's phone?

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,280
One of my own administration!
Where did they get such a daft idea?

55
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,920
- Sheer paranoia.
- The only thing is...

56
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,280
Why should we listen in to MPs?
Boring, stupid, ignorant windbags!

57
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,640
I do my best not to listen to them.

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,200
And he's only a PPS. I can't find out what's
going on at Defence. What could he know?

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,920
So I gather you denied that
Mr Halifax's phone had been bugged?

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,360
It was the one question to which I could give
a clear, simple, straightforward, honest answer.

61
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Yes, unfortunately, although the answer
was clear, simple and straightforward,

62
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,880
it is difficult to justifiably assign to it the fourth
of the epithets you applied to the statement...

63
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,640
...inasmuch as the precise correlation
between the information you communicated

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,520
and the facts insofar as
they can be determined and demonstrated

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,000
is such as to cause epistemological problems

66
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,480
of sufficient magnitude as to lay upon the logical
and semantic resources of the English language

67
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,800
a heavier burden than
they can reasonably be expected to bear.

68
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
Epistemological? What are you talking about?

69
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,440
You... told a lie.

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,560
- A lie?
- A lie.

71
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,720
- What do you mean, a lie?
- I mean, you...

72
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,280
...lied.

73
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,440
I know this is a difficult concept
to get across to a politician.

74
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,560
You... er... (MUTTERS)

75
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
Ah, yes, you did not tell the truth.

76
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,920
We ARE bugging his phone?

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
- We were.
- When did we stop?

78
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,320
Um... 17 minutes ago.

79
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,760
- Well, you can't call that lying!
- What is the opposite of telling the truth?

80
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,280
I mean, there was no intent.
I'd never knowingly mislead the House.

81
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,880
- Nonetheless you have done so.
- It wasn't my fault. I didn't know!

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,400
- You are deemed to have known.
- Why wasn't I told?

83
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,960
The Home Secretary
might not have felt the need to inform you.

84
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,720
- Why?
- Perhaps he didn't know either.

85
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,080
Or perhaps he'd been advised
that you did not need to know.

86
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,040
- I did need to know.
- The fact you needed to know

87
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,200
was not known at the time
that the now-known need to know was known.

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,960
Those that needed to advise the Home Secretary
felt that the information he needed

89
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,600
as to whether to inform the highest authority
was not yet known,

90
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,800
so there was no authority
for the authority to be informed

91
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,000
because the need to know
was not known or needed.

92
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
What?

93
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,760
- We could not know you'd deny it in the House.
- I would if I didn't know and were asked.

94
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,280
We did not know you'd be asked
when you didn't know.

95
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,440
I was bound to be asked when I didn't know
if I didn't know!

96
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,360
- What?
- What?

97
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,320
It was thought that it was better
not to inform you.

98
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,680
Halifax is one of your government team.
It was thought it was better not to create distrust.

99
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,040
- We only tell you when you should be aware.
- When's that?

100
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,960
You should now be aware
because you've denied it.

101
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,440
It would've been helpful if I'd been aware
before I denied it.

102
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,440
If you had been aware before you denied it,
you wouldn't have denied it.

103
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,640
- But I needed to know!
- We do not always tell you about bugging.

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,120
At times we need you not to know.

105
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,880
- Why did you decide I didn't?
- I didn't.

106
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,200
- Who did?
- Nobody. It was just nobody decided to tell you.

107
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,600
- It's the same thing!
- On the contrary.

108
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,760
To decide to conceal information from you
is a heavy burden for any official to shoulder,

109
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,400
but to decide not to reveal information to you
is routine procedure.

110
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,920
Humphrey, I need to know everything.

111
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,000
- Everything?
- Everything.

112
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,800
Very well.

113
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,160
Stationery deliveries this week.
Four dozen packets...

114
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,920
No, Humphrey, Humphrey, don't be silly.
I mean important things.

115
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Who should decide what is important?

116
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,760
- How can you defend this cock-up?
- As you said in the House, we got it wrong.

117
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,120
- YOU got it wrong.
- I am merely a humble servant, a lowly official.

118
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,760
- The Home Secretary made the decision.
- Any reason I shouldn't ask him to resign?

119
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,240
You should only ask him to resign
when he's made a mistake

120
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,400
which could've been seen at the time
and not with the benefit of hindsight.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,840
The trouble has arisen because of
your error of judgement in making this denial.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,480
- What?
- You shouldn't have denied what you didn't know.

123
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,840
That was your fault.
You admitted keeping secrets from me.

124
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,160
The system works perfectly well
as long as the PM tells the Civil Service

125
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,920
everything he's going to say before he says it.

126
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,680
Lf, precipitantly, he says something without first
clearing it with us, he has only himself to blame.

127
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,800
You must not say anything without clearing it.
With respect, PM, you must learn discretion.

128
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,680
- There was nothing to be discreet about!
- There's always something to be discreet about.

129
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,600
Anyway, why are we bugging Hugh Halifax?
Is he talking to the Russians?

130
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,000
No, the French, actually.
That's much more serious.

131
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,400
- Why?
- The Russians already know what we're doing.

132
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,800
But the French are our trusted allies,
whatever you think of them. And who doesn't?

133
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,560
No, Prime Minister, actually the French
are our mistrusted allies.

134
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,200
That is why talking directly to the French
is regarded as an act of treason

135
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,680
by the Foreign Office... who authorised it.

136
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,240
- I don't know.
- You... don't know what?

137
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,560
- Who authorised it. Who authorised it?
- Is there an echo?

138
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,920
- Who authorised this bugging?
- The Foreign Office! I've just said.

139
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,520
Anyway, the less said the better.
Wouldn't you agree, Prime Minister?

140
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,400
- About what?
- About everything.

141
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,080
One cannot refuse to appear
before a House committee.

142
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,240
- No, sir.
- One shall have to tell them everything.

143
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,800
- Everything they can find out from other sources.
- Precisely.

144
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,760
But they are likely to ask me if the PM has ever
authorised the bugging of an MP's telephone.

145
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,080
So how should a loyal public servant reply?

146
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,440
Er, you could say it was a question for the PM
or the Foreign Secretary or the Home Office.

147
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,039
Or it was a security matter -
can't confirm or deny.

148
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,040
If I dodge the question,
do you know what the next question will be?

149
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,680
Why will I not give the same clear denial
that the PM gave the House yesterday?

150
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,440
- Ah.
- What should I say then, Bernard?

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
Well, you could say the Prime Minister
knows more about it than you do.

152
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,120
Then they'd know I was lying.

153
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,800
- So... what will you do?
- I don't know, Bernard.

154
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I thought you should be aware of the dilemma.

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,240
- Would you like a glass of sherry, Bernard?
- Oh, yes, thank you. Sweet.

156
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
There's only dry.

157
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,400
Incidentally, Bernard, the BBC rang this morning.

158
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,280
- The BBC know about it?
- No, of course not.

159
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,560
They want to interview me for a documentary

160
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,120
they're making on Radio 3
about the structure of the government.

161
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,480
Gosh. You won't do it, will you?

162
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,280
- Why not?
- They may want you to say things.

163
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,160
That is quite normal on radio.

164
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,080
No, no, I mean interesting things. Controversy.

165
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,360
On the other hand,
one has a duty to put the record straight.

166
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,240
- You mean you want to do it?
- Well, not for oneself, of course.

167
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,160
No inclination for petty vanity,
you know, being a celebrity.

168
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,440
- But... one can be too self-effacing.
- I thought we were supposed to be faceless.

169
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,400
They don't show your face on radio.

170
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
They've said if I don't do it,
Arnold has said he would.

171
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,560
Perhaps that would be better.

172
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Arnold? For myself, I would rather not do it.

173
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,640
But one's sense of duty compels one
to see that Arnold

174
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,640
is not held up as an example of a top civil servant.

175
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,000
You'll need clearance from the Prime Minister,
but that won't be a problem.

176
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,160
- How do you know?
- Well, it's on Radio 3. Nobody'll be listening.

177
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,080
- Ah, Prime Minister.
- Humphrey.

178
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,040
The Cabinet agenda, Prime Minister.

179
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
- Is it today you do your interview?
- Oh, yes.

180
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,120
- Any problems?
- Oh, no, no, no.

181
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,080
I have some experience
in dealing with difficult questions.

182
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,600
If you're evasive or confusing on the radio, they
edit you out. You've really got to say something.

183
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,760
- Say something?
- Something simple and interesting.

184
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,400
Simple and interesting.

185
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,800
Perhaps you could advise me, Prime Minister,
particularly if the questions are aggressive.

186
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Even better. That puts listeners on your side.

187
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,120
- I may have to answer them.
- Why? You've never answered my questions.

188
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,280
No, no, no, that's different, Prime Minister.

189
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,120
Ludovic Kennedy might ask me
some perceptive questions.

190
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,320
His researchers mentioned that lots of people
are interested to know

191
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,160
why so much power is centralised in my hands.

192
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Lots of people?
Hardly anybody's ever heard of you, Humphrey!

193
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,600
- Perhaps they meant lots of Radio 3 listeners.
- That's a contradiction in terms!

194
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,960
If he does say that lots of people want to know
the answer to that question, say, "Name six."

195
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,760
That'll fix him.
He'll never be able to remember more than two.

196
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,720
Oh, excellent, Prime Minister. Any more tricks?

197
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,080
Tricks, Humphrey? This is technique.

198
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Attack one word in the sentence. Like frequently.
"Frequently? What do you mean, frequently?"

199
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,600
Or attack the interviewer. "You've clearly
never read the white paper, have you?"

200
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Or else ask your own question.

201
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,920
"That was a very interesting question.
Now let me ask you a question." See?

202
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,880
Oh, thank you, Prime Minister.

203
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,440
That reminds me, I have shortly
to appear before the committee

204
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,080
to answer questions
about the alleged bugging of an MP's phone.

205
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,800
Yes. Yes, Bernard told me. Well, you'll just
have to confirm what I said in the House.

206
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,160
- But that would be lying.
- Well, nobody'd know.

207
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,320
Oh, what a tangled web we weave.

208
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,600
You must.
Otherwise it'll look as though I was lying.

209
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,640
Humphrey, you have a loyalty.

210
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,840
To the truth.

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm sorry, Prime Minister, I cannot become
involved in some shabby cover-up.

212
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,680
Whereas there must be some element of shared
responsibility for the governance of Britain,

213
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,240
as between the legislators on the one hand
and the administration on the other,

214
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,400
the precise allocation of cause to consequence
or agency to eventuality in any particular instance

215
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,000
is invariably so complex as to be
ultimately invalid if not irresponsible.

216
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,960
I see, but could you be a bit more precise?

217
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,880
How far is the Civil Service to blame
for the level of unemployment?

218
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,039
Yes, of course, unemployment is a single name
applied by the media

219
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,240
to what is a wide range
of socio-economic phenomena

220
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,880
whose most politically visible manifestation
happens to be...

221
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,680
- Could you be a little bit more precise...
- I'm so sorry, Mr Kennedy.

222
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,640
You've asked me the question.
Do allow me to answer it.

223
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
There happens to be a current frequency

224
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,160
of weekly registrations
on the National Unemployment Register

225
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,179
which is deemed to be above
what has been held to be an acceptable level.

226
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,420
But even separating out the component causes,
let alone allocating responsibility for them,

227
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,140
is a task of such analytical delicacy

228
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,900
as not to be susceptible of compression within
the confines of a popular radio programme.

229
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,980
Sir Humphrey Appleby, thank you very much.

230
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,620
If that was a popular programme,
what would an unpopular programme be like?

231
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,780
Thank you, Sir Humphrey. Absolutely splendid.

232
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,619
My pleasure. Was I all right?

233
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,820
Couldn't you have said a bit more
about unemployment?

234
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,080
- Such as?
- Well... the truth.

235
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,800
- (HUMPHREY LAUGHS)
- Why do you laugh?

236
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,440
Oh, my dear Ludo,
nobody tells the truth about unemployment.

237
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,920
- Why not?
- Because everybody knows you can halve it.

238
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,680
- But how?
- Cut off all Social Security

239
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,440
to any claimant who refuses two job offers.

240
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,000
There's genuine unemployment in the north,
but the south is awash with layabouts,

241
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,760
many of them graduates living off the dole
and housing benefit

242
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,280
plus quite a lot of cash they pick up
without telling anybody.

243
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,920
- You mean moonlighting?
- Well, sunlighting, really.

244
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,560
Most employers will tell you they're short-staffed,
but offer the unemployed a street-sweeping job,

245
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,440
they'd be off the register
before you could say "parasite".

246
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,600
This country can have as much unemployment
as it's prepared to pay for in Social Security.

247
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,680
No politicians have got the guts to do anything.

248
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,800
- (LUDOVIC) Oh, I do wish you'd said that.
- (HUMPHREY) I'm sure you do.

249
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,240
- Sir Humphrey...
- Oh, come along.

250
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,600
- What's this for?
- The BBC have just sent me this tape.

251
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,640
Apparently, it's part of my interview.
They say it's particularly interesting.

252
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,840
- Your interview?
- You're surprised I said something interesting?

253
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,600
No, no, it's just that I thought you intended
to say nothing, as always. I mean...

254
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,840
Switch it on, Bernard. You may learn something.

255
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,560
<i>... Ludo, nobody tells the truth
about unemployment.</i>

<i>No politicians have got the guts to do anything.</i>

260
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
Sir Humphrey, that wasn't you, was it?

261
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,640
- Yes, Bernard.
- But how could you say such things?

262
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Is there any more?

263
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,040
- Yes, Bernard.
- As damaging as what we've just heard?

264
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,320
More damaging.

265
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,280
I believe I referred to... parasites.

266
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,920
- How could you be so indiscreet?
- The interview was over!

267
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,840
- We were just chatting! It was off the record!
- It was on the tape!

268
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,080
Oh, my God, I've just realised! Blackmail.

269
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,680
- Blackmail?
- Read that.

270
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,680
"Here is a copy of your off-the-record
part of the interview. Very interesting.

271
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,520
- "We will contact you shortly."
- What do they want of me?

272
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
The BBC? Licence fee up 50%?

273
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,680
- Maybe it's a private blackmail by the producer.
- Maybe.

274
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,520
Doesn't he know I'm a poor man?

275
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,480
Maybe he hasn't read you live in abject poverty
on 81,000 a year.

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,600
- What am I going to do?
- Keep your mouth shut in future.

277
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,240
And so must you! Don't breathe a word
about this to anyone! Anyone!

278
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
- My duty to the...
- (SPLUTTERS)

279
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,680
Oh, Bernard, what am I going to do?

280
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,160
Well, put out a press statement
expressing sympathy for the unemployed.

281
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,640
- Sympathy?
- You may be joining them any moment.

282
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,520
- Yes, Bernard?
- Excuse me, are you busy?

283
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,560
I am. I'm expecting Humphrey. I've got to decide
what to tell the Cabinet about this bugging.

284
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,400
Do I tell them the truth...
or do I tell them what I told the House?

285
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,120
Perhaps you should behave to the Cabinet
as you would expect them to behave to you.

286
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,520
You're quite right.
I'll tell them what I've told the House.

287
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
(COUGHS SIGNIFICANTLY)

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,920
- Something else?
- Yes, there is something you need to know.

289
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,360
- Need to know?
- Yes, it's about Sir Humphrey's broadcast.

290
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,659
- Boring?
- Initially, yes.

291
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,020
Then it livened up
as he became more and more indiscreet.

292
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,220
Humphrey? Indiscreet?

293
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,780
He thought the broadcast was over.
He was chatting, but the tape was still running.

294
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,140
- He fell for that old dodge?
- Yes.

295
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,620
You should always treat every microphone
as if it were live. Doesn't he know that?

296
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,180
- He hasn't done a lot of broadcasting.
- What did he say?

297
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,460
We could halve unemployment,
but the government hasn't the guts.

298
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,980
- What?!
- He didn't know he was being recorded.

299
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:29,660
And the BBC has the original? You know what
this means. All over the papers. Do something!

300
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:34,340
I already have. I had lunch with the producer.
He and I were at Oxford together.

301
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,900
He never intended to release the tape,

302
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,100
so I got him to give me the indiscreet bit
from the master tape.

303
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
This is the original?

304
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,980
Does Humphrey know you've got it?

305
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,340
- Shall I tell him?
- Why?

306
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,100
- I think he'd like to know.
- I'm sure he would.

307
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,660
But does he NEED to know?

308
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,180
Ah, somebody needs to know, but now you know,
Sir Humphrey doesn't need to know.

309
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,500
You need to know Sir Humphrey doesn't know,
but he doesn't need to know you know.

310
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,180
Thank you, Bernard,
I couldn't have put it less clearly myself.

311
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,140
- Like to hear the tape?
- Can you play this?

312
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,700
Oh, no, not that. I got him to give me a copy.

313
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,340
Oh, no, hold on a minute.
I think this deserves a wider audience.

314
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,900
- I think Humphrey ought to hear this.
- (BUZZER)

315
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,020
Yes?

316
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,860
Oh. It is Sir Humphrey.

317
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,780
What a happy coincidence.
Ask him to join us, Bernard.

318
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,660
Will you hold on a moment? Prime Minister,
I did tell you all this in confidence.

319
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,020
And I respect your confidence.

320
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,740
- This is serious, you know, Bernard.
- Oh, er, yes, Prime Minister.

321
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,340
Sir Humphrey.

322
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,100
Ah, Humphrey, come in, come in, come in!
(CHUCKLES)

323
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,940
- How did your broadcast go?
- Oh, very well, very well.

324
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,700
- What did you say?
- Oh, nothing in particular.

325
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,140
I pointed out some of the difficulties
in allocating responsibilities

326
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,220
as between politicians and civil servants.

327
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,020
- But you were discreet?
- Why do you ask?

328
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,140
- Were you or weren't you?
- Yes.

329
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,260
- Yes, you were or yes, you weren't?
- Yes.

330
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,140
- Humpy?
- Wouldn't you expect me to be discreet?

331
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,100
- Of course.
- There you are, then.

332
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,340
Good. Well, that's all right, then.

333
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,380
Why do you ask?

334
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,140
It's just that the BBC sent me a tape.

335
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,780
- A tape? What tape?
- A tape of your broadcast.

336
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,980
I thought we might listen to it.

337
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,460
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Why not?

338
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,820
- It isn't interesting.
- Not interesting?

339
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,340
- The Cabinet Secretary talking to the nation?
- Not VERY.

340
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,460
You mean you were too discreet?

341
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,900
Play it, would you, Bernard?

342
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,820
<i>Nobody tells the truth about unemployment.</i>

343
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,580
<i>- Why not?
- Because everyone knows you can halve it.</i>

344
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,340
<i>- How?
- Cut off all Social Security</i>

345
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,420
<i>to all claimants who refuse two j'ob offers.</i>

346
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
<i>There's genuine unemployment...</i>

347
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,740
- Humphrey!
- I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know!

348
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,100
- The interview was over!
- The indiscretion!

349
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,420
- The irresponsibility! Any more?
- No.

350
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,780
- Yes.
- Play it, Bernard.

351
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,500
<i>... be off the register
before you could say "parasite".</i>

352
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,700
<i>This country can have as much unemployment
as it's prepared to pay for in Social Security.</i>

353
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,140
<i>- No politicians have the guts to do anything.
- You said that?!</i>

354
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,660
It was Mike Yarwood.

355
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,540
I'm in somewhat of a difficulty
as to know what to do about this.

356
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,860
I need advice. Perhaps I ought to play it
to the Cabinet, get their reaction.

357
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,500
- Oh, please!
- Or the Privy Counsel.

358
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,460
- Or... Her Majesty?
- Oh, God!

359
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,420
Do you realise what damage it would do
if it got into the papers?

360
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,180
I could say I got it wrong!
I've checked and it isn't true!

361
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
- But it is.
- I could say it isn't!

362
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,740
- Nobody can prove it, it's never been tried!
- You'd tell an untruth in public?

363
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:40,220
- Yes, for YOU! We can issue a clarification.
- You've already made yourself very clear.

364
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,820
Prime Minister, a clarification is not to make
oneself clear, it is to put oneself in the clear.

365
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,820
Oh, what a tangled web we weave.

366
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,900
Give me the tape, would you, Bernard?
Now I've got something to tell you.

367
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,860
This is a copy,

368
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,220
but this is the original, the master.

369
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,340
- You mean...
- They were retrieved from the BBC.

370
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,940
By whom?

371
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,180
Intelligence.

372
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,220
So... no one else will ever know?

373
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,420
That rather depends on what I choose to tell them.

374
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Of course, I could just hand over the tapes or...

375
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,260
...I could hold onto them while I consider
the security and disciplinary implications.

376
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,260
I certainly have no intention of joining
"some shabby cover-up".

377
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Oh, that reminds me, have you decided yet
what you'll tell the Privileges Committee?

378
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,620
Oh, yes, yes, Prime Minister. I've decided that,
in the interests of national security,

379
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,460
that, um, the only honourable course
is to support your statement in the House.

380
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,220
And say that Hugh Halifax's phone
has never been bugged?

381
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,700
- And say I have no evidence...
- No!

382
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,500
And say the government has never authorised
the bugging of MPs' phones.

383
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:05,020
And say... the government has never author...
Supposing they find out the truth?

384
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,500
You'll just have to say that nobody told you

385
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,860
because you didn't need to know.

386
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,180
- Agreed?
- (SIGHS)

387
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,340
Splendid. That's settled, then.

388
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,500
May one have one's tapes back?

389
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,100
Tomorrow.

390
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,500
After the Committee on Privileges.
All right, Humphrey?

391
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Yes, Prime Minister.
