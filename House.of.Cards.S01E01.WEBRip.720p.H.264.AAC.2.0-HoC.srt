1
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,634
Hey, what
are you doing?

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,520
Jesus.
Did you get
a good look?

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,671
Blue Toyota Camry,
that's all I saw.

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,080
It's the Wartons' dog.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,475
Oh, man.

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,880
It's not gonna make it.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,030
Go see if they're home.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,714
It's okay.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,151
There are two
kinds of pain.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,272
The sort of pain
that makes you strong

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,240
or useless pain,
the sort of pain
that's only suffering.

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,320
I have no patience
for useless things.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,517
Moments like
this require someone
who will act.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,638
Who will do
the unpleasant thing,

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,473
the necessary thing.

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,074
There.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,640
No more pain.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,600
It was
a hit and run.
I'm awfully sorry.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,911
He must've jumped
over the fence again.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,198
Look, Steve is gonna
file a report on the car.
He'll put his people on it.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,158
We'll track them down.

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,714
Stunning.

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,270
Shall we?

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,317
...<i>three, two, one.</i>

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,710
Happy New Year!

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,070
Oh.

27
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,674
President-elect
Garrett Walker.

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,269
Do I like him? No.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,471
Do I believe in him?
That's beside the point.

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,677
Any politician that
gets 70 million votes

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,717
has tapped into
something larger
than himself,

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,110
larger than even me,
as much as I hate to admit it.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,039
Look at that winning smile,
those trusting eyes.

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,880
I latched onto him early on
and made myself vital.

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,193
After 22 years in Congress,
I can smell which way
the wind is blowing.

36
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,430
Jim Matthews, his Right
Honorable Vice President.

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,079
Former governor
of Pennsylvania.

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,598
He did his duty in
delivering the Keystone
State, bless his heart.

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,672
Now they're about to
put him out to pasture.

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,150
But he looks
happy enough,
doesn't he?

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,551
For some, it's simply
the size of the chair.

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,590
Linda Vasquez,
Walker's chief of staff.
I got her hired.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,390
She's a woman, check.
And a Latina, check.
But more important than that,

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,276
she's as tough as
a two-dollar steak.
Check, check, check.

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,680
When it comes to
the White House,

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,717
you not
only need the keys
in your back-pocket,

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,439
you need the gatekeeper.

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,240
As for me,
I'm just the lowly
House Majority Whip.

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,152
I keep things
moving in a Congress

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,112
choked by
pettiness and lassitude.

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,557
My job is to clear the pipes
and keep the sludge moving.

52
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,279
But I won't have to be
a plumber much longer.

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,353
I've done my time.
I've backed the right man.

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,520
Give and take.

55
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,438
Welcome to Washington.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,639
You need a haircut.

57
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,040
You think?

58
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,640
A little trim.

59
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,234
What are you
going to wear?

60
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,158
You mean for
the meeting?
For the announcement.

61
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,114
I'll wear my navy blue,
the one with the pinstripes.

62
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,113
Good. You look
handsome in that suit.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,310
I don't know if
they'll announce
before your board meeting.

64
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,473
As long as I can say
the donation is coming.

65
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,997
Soon as it's official,
SanCorp will
write you a check.

66
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,155
This is going to be
a big year for us.

67
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,640
They're gonna want
to start with something big.

68
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,274
That's why I'm here

69
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,680
Really? What?

70
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,195
I'd say immigration,
banking or education.

71
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,192
But none of my regular
sources can confirm that.

72
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,352
Because they don't
know, or because
they're not talking?

73
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,596
Because they don't know.

74
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,439
Keep at it.
Get me something.

75
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,392
Sorry. Sorry,
Mr. Hammerschmidt. Zoe.

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,679
Barnes.
Right.

77
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,199
Did it take him a year
to remember your name?

78
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,310
Longer.

79
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,876
Good morning, Lucas.

80
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,031
What can I do
for you, Zoe?

81
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,757
I am sick of
the Fairfax
County Council.

82
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,876
You tell me every day.

83
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,394
Move me online.

84
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,550
My own blog.

85
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,552
First person.
Subjective. 500 words.

86
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,676
Not gonna happen.

87
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,750
I'll go underground.

88
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,394
Back rooms, the urinals.

89
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,199
I'll win over staff
members on the Hill.

90
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,232
They need
a place to vent.
A gossip column.

91
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,754
No. We lift the veil.

92
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,399
What's really going on.

93
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,359
This is
<i>The Washington Herald,</i>
Zoe, it's not <i>TMZ.</i>

94
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,916
Do you know how
many people watch <i>TMZ?</i>
I couldn't care less.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,878
Which is why print
journalism is dying.

96
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,112
Then it'll die with
dignity. At least
at this paper.

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,153
You're stuck in
the 20th century, Lucas.
You lack imagination.

98
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,519
Maybe so, but right
now, I don't need
imagination, I need copy.

99
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,629
Your nights and
weekends are yours.

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,995
I applaud whatever
you want to do,

101
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,555
as long as it's
not on my time.

102
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,594
You're telling me
to get back to work.
I am.

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,558
What you're
really telling me
is to fuck off.

104
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,199
I'm telling you both.

105
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,197
It's Mr. Chapman, already,
from Province Trust.

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,034
Hold my calls, Christina.

107
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,595
Henry.

108
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,436
It's good to see you.

109
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,472
How long are you
in town for?
Just today.

110
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,631
You gotta come
back down for
the inauguration.

111
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,156
I can hook you up.

112
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,720
How about you hook me up
with the zoning laws

113
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,870
you promised to get changed?

114
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,954
We've got 12 million
sitting in escrow

115
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,639
for an empty lot
we can't build on.

116
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,680
I know. But you
gotta understand, it's
a local municipal issue.

117
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,638
I can't just
pick up the phone...
You can't?

118
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,393
Because that's not
what you led us to believe

119
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,279
when you begged for
50 grand in donations.

120
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,591
Right.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,275
One sec.

122
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,479
Christina, I said no
calls. Not while I'm
meeting with Mr. Chapman.

123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,630
The President-elect?

124
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,876
Do you mind?

125
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,679
No, go ahead, please.

126
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,877
Put him through,
Christina.

127
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,953
Mr. President-elect.

128
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,678
Thank you. Yes, we were...
We were pleased to
win by double digits.

129
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,513
Absolutely,
anything you need.

130
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,035
I need you to
put your long, wet,

131
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,635
talented tongue
between my thighs

132
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,871
and make me
squeal like Monica...

133
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,477
Me too, me too.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,753
Okay. Thank you, sir.

135
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,920
I'm so sorry.
Where were we?

136
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,760
Walker, what's he like?

137
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,472
Is the President-elect
running late?

138
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,597
No. He couldn't make it.
I'll brief him, though.

139
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,719
Okay.

140
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,075
This is the memo I drafted

141
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,117
on our Middle East policy
we've been developing.

142
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,634
Now, I wanna borrow
from Reagan,

143
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,599
I'd like to coin the phrase
"trickle-down diplomacy."

144
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,792
That way...
Frank, I'm going
to stop you there.

145
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,389
We're not nominating you
for Secretary of State.

146
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,230
I know he made
you a promise, but
circumstances have changed.

147
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,754
The nature of
promises, Linda,

148
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,958
is that they remain immune
to changing circumstances.

149
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,600
Garrett has thought long
and hard about this,

150
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,115
and he's decided we need
you to stay in Congress.

151
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,594
When was this
decision made?

152
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,998
And why wasn't I
part of a conversation?

153
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,434
I'm sorry, Frank.
If it had been up to me,

154
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,954
I wouldn't have waited
this long to tell you.

155
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,635
So you knew you
were going to do this.

156
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,513
It has been
an evolving discussion.

157
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,672
It's a chicken-shit move.

158
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,196
Frank...
I was vetted.

159
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,475
Was that a ruse?
No.

160
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,880
Let's be absolutely clear.

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,480
You wouldn't
have won without me.

162
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,756
You're right.
But now we have to lead,

163
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,151
and that means
making tough choices.

164
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,115
As you know,
education is
a top priority for us.

165
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,759
A complete
federal overhaul.

166
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,400
But it's not just
education, Frank.
Congress is split.

167
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,440
We need you there
more than we need you
in the State Department.

168
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,634
I got you
hired, Linda.

169
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,717
I know.
Donations, endorsements.

170
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,396
I wrote the campaign's
entire foreign
policy platform.

171
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,637
I bring years
of foreign affairs
committee...

172
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,439
Frank, please.

173
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,912
I wanna speak to
Walker personally.

174
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,112
The decision is made.

175
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,033
We need you, Frank.

176
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,877
Will you stand
beside us or not?

177
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,752
Of course. If that's
what the President wants.

178
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,998
I'm very glad
to hear that.

179
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,231
I'm curious.
If not me, then who?

180
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,274
Michael Kern.

181
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,756
Well, that is
an excellent choice.

182
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,430
Can we make
it more clear?

183
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,159
I just want to make
sure it doesn't look like

184
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,919
we're neglecting
our domestic...

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,072
No. No, no, no.
I'm gonna say that we're
expanding our mission.

186
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,389
Okay.

187
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,200
And we're bringing
on a new organization
to help us.

188
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,350
Do you know
which one yet?

189
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,875
I'm still looking into
a few options, but...

190
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,274
Tell me, what did we agree
on, that we could hire
how many new people?

191
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,716
Six?
Six, maybe seven.

192
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,712
We'll have enough.

193
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,120
It's exciting.

194
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,874
This new direction
we're heading.

195
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,031
I just don't know
where we're going to fit
all the people.

196
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,873
Do you think we
have to look into
additional space?

197
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,917
No, no, no, no.
I'll find a way.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,673
Okay, so make the changes
to the PowerPoint

199
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,274
and let's meet
again at 2:30.

200
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,874
Okay.

201
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,160
It's me.

202
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,152
I feel like
an idiot leaving
messages like this.

203
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,720
Call me back.

204
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,870
What is it, Zoe?

205
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,230
Um...

206
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,353
I know you're going
to have your hands full
at the White House,

207
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,911
so if you need
someone to do research
or punch out background...

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,320
I think I'll be fine.

209
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,710
Well, if things
get hectic, and
you need any help.

210
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,000
So you can blog
about rubbing shoulders
with the big boys?

211
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,669
What did Lucas tell you?

212
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,479
Look, no offense,
Zoe, but I don't have time

213
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,353
to be anyone's
training wheels.

214
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,313
I just thought...

215
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,876
No, I was actually
offering to lend a hand.

216
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,391
That's it.
Got it. Thanks.

217
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,119
Claire...
You didn't call.

218
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,880
I was...
You didn't call
me, Francis.

219
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,996
Nine hours.
You don't not call me.

220
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,514
Not when it's this big.

221
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,795
You're right.

222
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,475
When have we ever
avoided each other?

223
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,798
I wanted
a solution first.

224
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,836
Do you have one?

225
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,956
Not yet.

226
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,397
This affects me
too, Francis.

227
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,351
And it's not the money
I'm upset about.

228
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,750
It's that we do
things together.

229
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,671
When you don't involve me,
we're in free fall.

230
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,269
I should have
called you
and I didn't.

231
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,714
What happened?

232
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,476
She says they need to
keep me in Congress.

233
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,710
Linda said that?

234
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,154
Walker wasn't even there.

235
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,310
That's what
really gets me.

236
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,232
He didn't have
the courage to
look me in the eye...

237
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,595
I knew you shouldn't
trust that woman.

238
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,592
I didn't. I don't.
I don't trust anyone.

239
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,952
Then how could you
not see this coming?

240
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,632
I never thought
they were capable.

241
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,631
You don't usually
underestimate people,
Francis.

242
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,836
I know.

243
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,916
Hubris. Ambition.

244
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,036
You should be angry.

245
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,110
I'm livid.

246
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,839
Then where is that?
I don't see it.

247
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,950
What do you
want me to do?

248
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,793
Scream and yell?
Throw a tantrum?

249
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,991
I want more than I'm
seeing. You're better
than this, Francis.

250
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,116
Well, I'm sorry,
Claire.

251
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,317
I am sorry.

252
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,357
No. That I won't accept.

253
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,079
What?
Apologies.

254
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,673
My husband doesn't
apologize, even to me.

255
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,916
How long have
you been up?

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,036
Hours.

257
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,438
I know what
I have to do.

258
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,590
Good.

259
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,000
We'll have a lot
of nights like this,

260
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,551
making plans,
very little sleep.

261
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,476
I expected that.
That doesn't worry me.

262
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,558
I better get to work.

263
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,749
I laid a suit out
for you upstairs.

264
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,393
The navy blue one.

265
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,996
I love that woman.
I love her more
than sharks love blood.

266
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,800
Why do you think
they went with him?

267
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,679
We're too good.
They can't afford to
lose us in Congress.

268
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,675
He's had work done.
A chin tuck probably.
He definitely dyes his hair.

269
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,510
Do we say anything?

270
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,956
No. God, no.
Not unless he brings it up.

271
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,872
Nancy?

272
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,830
9:25...
Cancel everything.

273
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,877
Stamper, you're with me.

274
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,515
Now, look...

275
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,636
They've done us
a great favor, Doug.

276
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,280
We are no longer
bound by allegiances.

277
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,396
We serve no one.

278
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,271
We live by one rule
and one rule only,

279
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,637
never again will we
allow ourselves to be
put in such a position.

280
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,910
Walker and Vasquez.

281
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,959
All of them.
I hold them
all accountable.

282
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,076
Retribution?
No.

283
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,874
No. It's more than that.

284
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,680
Take a step back.

285
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,200
Look at
the bigger picture.

286
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,272
I think I see what
you're getting at.
Kern first?

287
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,195
That's how you
devour a whale, Doug.
One bite at a time.

288
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,516
Who would you want?
For Secretary of State?

289
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,718
Give me a list of choices.
And however we do this,

290
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,393
we'll also need a buffer.

291
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,914
You mean an errand boy?
Yes.

292
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,037
Somebody we
control completely.

293
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,078
I'll keep my
ear to the ground.
Good.

294
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,711
I haven't eaten
since yesterday.

295
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,435
I almost pity him.

296
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,876
He didn't choose to
be put on my platter.

297
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,077
When I carve him up
and toss him to the dogs,

298
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,313
only then will he
confront that brutal,
inescapable truth.

299
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,316
"My God, all I ever
amounted to was chitlins."

300
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,600
"And he that
shall humble himself
shall be exalted."

301
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,550
Matthew 23:12.

302
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,391
Thanks be to God.

303
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,314
I'd like to speak today
on the subject of humility.

304
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,914
A lot of you have
just won re-election.

305
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,196
If you hadn't,
you might not
be sitting here.

306
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,799
And of course,
we should enjoy our success,
and be grateful for it.

307
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,237
But never let your
gratitude sour into pride.

308
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,796
You'll have many
challenges ahead over
the next couple of years.

309
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,554
And a person's character
isn't determined

310
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,400
by how he or she
enjoys victory,

311
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,952
but rather how he
or she endures defeat.

312
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,196
Nothing can help
us endure dark times
better than our faith.

313
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,309
Claire.

314
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,715
Hello, Felicity.

315
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,598
How are you?
Good. How are you?

316
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,754
Good. I'm sorry about that.
It's just not right.

317
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,593
Charles and I can't
understand what
Walker was thinking.

318
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,639
That's very sweet
of you, but really,
between you and me,

319
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,076
I think Francis
is relieved.

320
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,272
He just feels
much more at home
in Congress.

321
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,750
I would've bet
a million dollars
they were going to pick you.

322
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,231
Well, it's a good thing
you have a million
dollars to spare.

323
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,994
But you are by far
and away the only choice.

324
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,400
I appreciate you
saying that.

325
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,960
I mean, Michael?
Come on.

326
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,190
He's got half
the experience you do...

327
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,436
Garrett is a smart man.

328
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,113
He knows what he's doing.

329
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,669
You're a bigger man
than I, Frank.

330
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,399
You want some
of that wine?

331
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,679
Yes, definitely.

332
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,434
Man, this is some good shit.
Where did you get it?

333
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,160
I kind of lifted
it from the VIP room

334
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,920
of the Speakers'
holiday party.

335
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,233
I'm impressed.
Bordeaux, 20 years old.

336
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,272
It seemed about
right for you.
Ouch.

337
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,360
Why would you
say that to me?

338
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,671
I'm almost 30.
That's practically
ancient in your book.

339
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,877
I don't discriminate
when it comes to age.
Really?

340
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,792
When's the last
time you hired
a 40-year-old staffer?

341
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,750
Doesn't mean I wouldn't.

342
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,194
As long as she's
good in the sack.

343
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,430
Come on.

344
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,710
Well, it's true,
isn't it?

345
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,432
Where's this coming from?

346
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,351
You're not gonna
just toss me aside

347
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,711
for some slut
straight out of Vassar?

348
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,319
So we're having
that conversation.

349
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,074
It's been six months.
It's not a little
office fling anymore.

350
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,597
You want me to say
those three magic words.

351
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,672
One of which
starts with an L.

352
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,638
Okay, I'll say 'em.

353
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,312
Christina Gallagher,

354
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,395
lick my balls.

355
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,915
Oh, my...
You're a bastard.

356
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
I love you.

357
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,318
I love you, Christina.

358
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,834
I love you.

359
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,953
Now will you
lick my balls?

360
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,193
So I'm curious.
Are we patrons,
benefactors or lepers?

361
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,112
Believe it or not,
we're angels.

362
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,352
I'm gonna go outside
and pretend to
use my cell phone.

363
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,430
Go.

364
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,956
Oh!

365
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,150
Can I have your jacket?

366
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,230
Yeah.

367
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,879
Okay.

368
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,074
Are you coming to bed?

369
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,152
I'll be up in a bit.

370
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,469
Don't stay up all night.

371
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,920
No, I'll be right there.

372
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,234
Thanks so much.
I'll call you.

373
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,350
Wait. I thought
you had a good time.

374
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,353
I did. I loved it.
I've never been before.

375
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,557
Well, maybe
I could come up.

376
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,636
Oh.

377
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,435
Brian, you're
so sweet. Really.

378
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,678
But if I was going to
fuck you, you'd know.

379
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,274
Thanks so much.

380
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,913
She's here.
Send her in.

381
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,277
It's quite rare for
a president's chief of staff
to climb the Hill.

382
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,512
A gesture of respect,
no doubt, or desperation.

383
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,957
I'm guessing she'll say
Donald Blythe for Education.

384
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,878
Let's see if I'm right.

385
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,112
Good morning, Linda.

386
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,038
Thank you so much
for making the trip up.

387
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,674
Of course. My pleasure.

388
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,479
Education?

389
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,880
First things first.

390
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,316
The seating chart
for the inauguration.

391
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,471
How do these two
work for you and Claire?

392
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,550
Wow.

393
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,915
They come with
a complimentary set

394
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,309
of tickets to
the Jefferson Ball.

395
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,993
Claire will be
over the moon.

396
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,037
Good, I'm so glad.

397
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,195
So, education.

398
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,476
We have Donald Blythe
drafting the legislation.

399
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,392
Donald Blythe? Jesus.
I know.

400
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,516
So you want a bill
just two steps
left of Karl Marx?

401
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,273
I advised the
President-elect
against it,

402
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,159
but Donald is
the face of education.

403
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,550
He's been pushing
reform for 25 years.

404
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,074
You want me to
guide him to the middle.

405
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,231
We need a bill
we can pass.

406
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,959
Do I have absolute autonomy
and authority on this?

407
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,111
There's more.

408
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,671
Garrett wants
the bill on the floor
in the first 100 days.

409
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,151
He wants to make a pledge
in his inaugural address.

410
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,754
That's...

411
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,114
That's very ambitious,
Linda.

412
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,032
Can we make that pledge?

413
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,076
A hundred days?

414
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,640
I can deliver.

415
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,476
Keep me posted.

416
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,631
I'll talk with Donald.
I'll check in with
you later in the week.

417
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,949
Terrific.

418
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,713
Did you smell that?

419
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,031
The smugness?
The false deference?

420
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,794
She thinks I can be
bought with a pair
of tickets. What am I?

421
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,712
A whore
in post-war Berlin

422
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,998
salivating
over free stockings
and chocolate?

423
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,874
What she's asking will
cost far more than that.

424
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,549
Ferguson?
Too old.

425
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,711
Willis?
Too stupid.

426
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,836
Boyd?
Too queer.

427
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,869
Really?

428
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,674
He's married
with three kids.

429
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,910
And wouldn't
they be devastated.

430
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,190
All right.

431
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,070
What about
Catherine Durant?

432
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,156
Cathy Durant.
She was vocally
anti-Walker.

433
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,833
She's got the experience.

434
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,993
Set up a meeting.

435
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,830
Hey.

436
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,960
The donation
from SanCorp?

437
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,792
The money will
have to come from
somewhere else.

438
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,154
What happened?

439
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,436
I've looked over
the budget for fiscal '13

440
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,752
and we've allocated
$1.6 million for salaries.

441
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,792
We need to
cut that in half.

442
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,039
You're suggesting...

443
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,719
Evelyn, we're going
to let some people go.

444
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,999
That would be
half of our staff.

445
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,231
We have to
carve out some room.

446
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,357
You would have to fire
some essential people

447
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,557
who have been with us
since the beginning.

448
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,519
We are a charity,
but not for our employees.

449
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,990
You know, Claire,
I've held my tongue about

450
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,555
this whole international
thing for a while,

451
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,915
but I don't get it.

452
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,593
We are really good
at what we do.

453
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,280
Why do we have to try
and be something we're not?

454
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,874
Because we've
plateaued, Evelyn.

455
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,634
And it is time
for us, for our entire
organization...

456
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,031
But digging wells in Africa?
We don't know
anything about that.

457
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,352
Which is why
we have to
bring in new people.

458
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,909
This is the plan
that I've proposed
to the board

459
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,475
and we are moving
forward with it.

460
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,075
I'd like a list
of names, please.

461
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,591
Claire, can we just
think about this?

462
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,151
I have thought about it.
I've put a lot of
thought into it.

463
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,435
But I think...

464
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,830
Evelyn, you're
the office manager.

465
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,993
I need you to trust that
I know what I'm doing.

466
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,834
So please get me that list
as soon as possible.

467
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,992
Ma'am. You can't go up.
I'm sorry.

468
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,998
I just have
one question.
No. No.

469
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,952
Sir, I apologize,
this woman...
Congressman.

470
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,190
Miss, you need to
step away from the door.

471
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,237
If I could just
have one second.
Step away from the...

472
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,355
Who are you?

473
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,353
My name is Zoe Barnes.
I'm a reporter at
the <i>Washington Herald.</i>

474
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,833
It is after
10:30 at night
and this is my home.

475
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,119
I do not allow...
We're part of a mutual
admiration society.

476
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,994
You're a fan
of the symphony.

477
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,316
More for the
people-watching
than the music.

478
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,759
It's all right, Steve.
Come on in, Ms. Barnes.

479
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,480
It's strong.

480
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,040
You'd prefer it weak?

481
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,316
No, the stronger
the better.

482
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,239
There's no harm
in looking.

483
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,755
That's a cheap ploy.

484
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,638
It's cheap but effective.

485
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,716
Well, you certainly have
my undivided attention.

486
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,753
Good,
the reason I'm here...
Oh...

487
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,036
Is foreplay over?

488
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,597
I read somewhere
that JFK never lasted
more than three minutes.

489
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,239
The point being?

490
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,515
Time is precious.

491
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,831
Powerful people don't have
the luxury of foreplay.

492
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,158
Okay. So why are
you here, Ms. Barnes?

493
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,672
I need somebody
I can talk to.

494
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,872
We're talking.
Tell me what
we're talking about.

495
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,000
I protect your identity,
I print whatever you tell me.

496
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,878
And I'll never
ask any questions.

497
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,350
And what makes you think
I don't already have
such an arrangement

498
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,556
with one of
your colleagues?

499
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,836
Because if you did,
you wouldn't have
let me through the door.

500
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,036
I've led a very long,
very successful career

501
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,635
avoiding this sort of
intrigue with the press.

502
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,677
I can't see any
advantage in starting now.

503
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,319
But is there
any disadvantage?

504
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,834
Sloppiness, for one.

505
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,832
I promise you
absolute discretion.

506
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,799
So we're talking
about trust.

507
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,314
Use whatever word you like.

508
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,392
Words matter very
much, Ms. Barnes.

509
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,790
You should care
more about them,
given your profession.

510
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,960
Then yes, your trust.

511
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,396
So which Zoe Barnes
am I to trust?

512
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,311
The one who wrote
about the fireman
that married the meter maid?

513
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,960
Or the one who
authored a very
fine article

514
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,640
on a new jogging path
in Rock Creek Park.

515
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,518
Don't be flattered.
I read everything.

516
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,512
I'm better than what
they have me doing.

517
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,915
You know what
that feels like.

518
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,309
Do I?

519
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,671
You would have made
a great Secretary of State.

520
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,756
How exactly may I
help you, Ms. Barnes?

521
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,877
You must know
the administration's
legislative agenda.

522
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,319
What's coming up first.
I may.

523
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,556
Will you tell me?

524
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,229
What would be your guess?

525
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,238
Education.
Why?

526
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,109
Immigration is
too controversial.
Tax-reform isn't sexy enough.

527
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,960
Everyone can get
behind children.

528
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,556
Is it education?

529
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,031
You might very
well think that.
I couldn't possibly comment.

530
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,430
A hint.

531
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,076
It's late, Ms. Barnes.

532
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,350
Can we talk again?

533
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,319
I hope you'll understand
that I want to
sleep on all this.

534
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,119
I never make
such big decisions

535
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,795
so long after sunset
and so far from dawn.

536
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,552
My cell phone's
on the back.

537
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,392
Did you put Ms. Barnes
in the visitors' ledger?

538
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,880
Not yet.
Don't.

539
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,633
Needless to say.
Needless.

540
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,750
Hello.

541
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,991
Claire, this is
Ms. Zoe Barnes,
of the <i>Washington Herald.</i>

542
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,434
She was just leaving.

543
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,992
Very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Underwood.

544
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,194
Drive safe.
There's a lot of ice
on the road.

545
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,829
I will. Thank you.

546
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,834
Does that work
on anybody?

547
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,400
Does what?

548
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,309
The push-up bra
and the V-neck tee?

549
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,194
Well, if it does,
I don't know who they are.

550
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,718
Okay. Relax, relax.

551
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,198
License
and registration.

552
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,351
The glove compartment,
sweetheart.

553
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,795
This isn't your
driver's license.
It's a Starbucks card.

554
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,758
Oh, shit. Sorry.

555
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,916
Sir, have you
been drinking?

556
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,640
No, I never drink
coffee at this hour.

557
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,919
I'm going to need you
to step out of the car.

558
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,312
If I was speeding,
you can write me a ticket...

559
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,598
Sir, step out of
the car right now.

560
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,438
Look, I don't want to
be a prick, but I'm
a member of Congress.

561
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,793
I don't care if you're
the King of China.

562
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,232
China doesn't
have a king.

563
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,232
It's a communist
ogliwarchy...

564
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,914
Let's go. Out.
You too, sweetie.

565
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,434
Fuck, that is
hard to say.

566
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,755
Hello?

567
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,437
Good. Well,
let's get him out.

568
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,232
Mind if I join you?

569
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,551
What the fuck
is going on?

570
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,960
I thought I was meeting...

571
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,480
No. You're meeting me.

572
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,313
It's 4:00 in
the goddamn morning.

573
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,233
I've got a city
council meeting in...

574
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,314
You've been police
commissioner for what,
almost a decade now?

575
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,837
We're here to
talk about my resume?

576
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,589
Mayor of D.C. would
look good on that
resume, wouldn't it?

577
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,879
We know that you've
been angling to run
for some time.

578
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,519
Experience is
your strong suit.

579
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,960
Endorsement and
fundraising are not.

580
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,996
We can help with that.

581
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,839
Russo, you're
free to go.

582
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,590
<i>It was just
a few drinks.</i>

583
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,790
<i>It was enough
to get pulled over.</i>

584
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,360
<i>I wasn't drunk-drunk.</i>

585
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,196
Were you alone?

586
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,510
Yes.

587
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,440
Say it to my face.
Watch the road.

588
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,795
Say it to my face!

589
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,872
Yes, I was alone!

590
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,757
You cannot keep
doing this, Peter.

591
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,031
It's going to
catch up with you.

592
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,190
I know.

593
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,712
Do you think we
can arrange two more

594
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,638
at our table for
the Jefferson Ball?

595
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,871
For whom?
The Holburns.

596
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,679
Why on earth would
you want them there?

597
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,519
I'm going to need
her money for the CWI.

598
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,353
The staff cuts
are just not enough.

599
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,079
I'll talk to Vasquez.

600
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,799
How're we doing?
Good.

601
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,190
Progress.
Irons in the fire.

602
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,634
I like irons.

603
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,359
But I love fire.

604
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,670
Yes...

605
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,075
What are you...

606
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,469
The bill is garbage, Donald.

607
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,678
Tax increases?
Ban on vouchers?
Federal oversight?

608
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,194
How do you expect
me to get that
through a committee?

609
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,919
When Linda told
me to write it,
she promised...

610
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,633
I'm sure she said
any number of things.

611
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,433
Forget what they
promised you, Donald.

612
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,240
They want your name
because it carries weight.

613
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,039
Well, my name
comes with my ideas.

614
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,032
I understand,
but you've got
to be reasonable.

615
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,190
This isn't the Great Debate.

616
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,590
It's about passing
meaningful reform.

617
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,997
Maybe not everything
you would hope.
But help me help you.

618
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,440
That's going
to take time.

619
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,714
Those ideas, I've been
developing them for...

620
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,678
If it's time you need,
I will buy you time.

621
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,956
But you've got to
promise me your next at bat

622
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,396
is gonna give me
something I can work with.

623
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,795
Okay, Frank,
I'll see what I can do.

624
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,112
Good. And, Donald,
don't let this get you down.

625
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,640
Together,
we're going to do more

626
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,160
than you've been
able to do in 25 years.

627
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,713
Two things are
now irrelevant.

628
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,110
Donald Blythe
and Donald Blythe's
new draft.

629
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,317
Eventually,
I'll have to re-write
the bill myself.

630
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,357
Forward, that is
the battle-cry.

631
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,831
Leave ideology to
the arm-chair generals.
It does me no good.

632
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,752
Walker just nominated Kern.

633
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,196
It's a long road
to confirmation.

634
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,076
Kern is a boy scout.

635
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,834
Nobody's a boy scout.
Not even Boy Scouts.

636
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,874
What do you have?
Absolutely nothing.

637
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,472
Then what are
we talking about?

638
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,314
Just asking a simple
question, does the
job interest you?

639
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,597
Why would you
want Michael gone?

640
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,876
Cathy, you and
I came up together.

641
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,111
The Foreign Affairs
Committee needs
a secretary we can work with.

642
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,114
Someone who isn't
afraid to stand up
to Walker when he's wrong.

643
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,520
We need you.

644
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,679
Let's assume
I am interested.

645
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,554
I don't want
to assume.
I want to know.

646
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,954
2... Okay. 2-6-3-7.

647
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,078
Please hold. Zoe Barnes.

648
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,158
Anywhere you want.

649
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,435
On my way. I'll gonna
have to call you back.

650
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,639
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't catch a cab.
I had to take a train and I...

651
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,553
Just before you
left my house.

652
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,238
Think back.
What were
we discussing?

653
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,000
The president's
legislative agenda.

654
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,440
Specifically.

655
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,356
Education.

656
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,917
Was I right?
Do the math,
Ms. Barnes.

657
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,630
He needs a bill.

658
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,910
Sponsored by?

659
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,599
You?
Be smarter than that.

660
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,760
Somebody with legitimacy.
Good.

661
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,480
And who screams
"legitimacy"
in Education?

662
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,116
Donald Blythe?
Correct.

663
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,793
The problem is...

664
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,639
He's an old-school
tax-and-spend liberal.

665
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,440
Walker ran as a moderate.

666
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,160
You think Blythe
would talk to me?

667
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,199
He doesn't have to.

668
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,076
Wait...

669
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,119
We're in a very gray area,
ethically, legally,
which I'm okay with...

670
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,590
I just love
this painting,
don't you?

671
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,277
We're in
the same boat now, Zoe.

672
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,831
Take care not to tip it
over. I can only save one
of us from drowning.

673
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,640
He announces
his education
initiative on Monday.

674
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,710
Half of the address is...

675
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,790
I understand.

676
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,996
Do we need
to take it out?

677
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,190
We're fine, Linda.

678
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,795
But you just
got through saying
he has to start over.

679
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,633
I didn't choose
Blythe. You did.

680
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,474
You put him in my lap
and asked me to work
a miracle, and I will.

681
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,279
Now, have a little
faith, Linda.

682
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,153
Let me work with
Donald on this.

683
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,550
I know what can
be accomplished
in 100 days.

684
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,311
All right, Frank,
we're counting on you.

685
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,470
Good.

686
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,719
Now, I do have
a little favor to ask.

687
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,110
Do you think I can get
just two more tickets

688
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,630
for my table at
the Jefferson Ball?

689
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,070
Drink?

690
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,080
Sure, what do you got?

691
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,720
Whiskey. Blends.

692
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,950
If you're offering.

693
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,633
So, how are things in
the City of Brotherly Love?

694
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,439
We're getting by.

695
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,432
Good, good.

696
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,753
I'm sorry, I
made that neat.
Did you want...

697
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,718
No, this is perfect.

698
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,433
So, it seems
you've been
a bit irresponsible.

699
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,954
What?

700
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,440
Don't play dumb
with me, Peter.

701
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,598
Save it for
the ethics committee.

702
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,636
Drink up, you could
use a little
courage right now.

703
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,430
You're not having one?

704
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,472
It's a bit early
in the day for me.

705
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,836
Is this about
the other night?

706
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,280
How do you
know about that?

707
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,875
I'm the Whip.
It's my job to know.

708
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,873
Look, they let me off.
There's no charges.

709
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,360
It's all taken care of.

710
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,629
Honestly, Peter,
do you really think

711
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,315
these things
just take care
of themselves?

712
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,150
You...

713
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,155
It was just this
one time, Frank.
I swear to God.

714
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,516
Then you must hold
God in very low esteem,

715
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,990
because we both know
that's a lie.

716
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,834
Solicitation,
controlled substances,

717
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,832
driving under
the influence...

718
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,955
You've got quite
a long list of hobbies.

719
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,835
What is it you want?

720
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,791
Your absolute,
unquestioning loyalty.

721
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,270
Always.

722
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,400
Do not misunderstand
what I mean by loyalty.

723
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,439
Anything. Name it, Frank.

724
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,273
You seem far
too relaxed.

725
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,953
I'm not.

726
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,759
You shouldn't be.

727
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,110
Doug will be in touch.

728
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,997
Hang on. Where
have you been?
I've been calling you.

729
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,639
Everybody's
working double-time
on inauguration

730
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,393
and you just up
and disappear...

731
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,230
Hang on.

732
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,510
Let me call you back.

733
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,273
Where did you get this?
Wrong question.

734
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,149
The right question is
how quickly can we
get it up on the site?

735
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,594
I have to run
this past Tom.

736
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,998
Let's get legal on this,
make sure we're not
breaking any laws.

737
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,910
You won't tell
me your source?

738
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,076
I can't do that.

739
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,919
Fine. But if legal
finds even one...
I understand.

740
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,320
How long do you
think that will take?

741
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,715
We should get this
online right away.

742
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,473
I'm not just
going to scan
a 300-page document

743
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,199
and put it up
before we've gone
through every...

744
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,430
I did that already.

745
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,640
The whole thing?
Cover to cover.

746
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,397
I've got excerpts. Analysis.
3,000 words ready for editing.

747
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,550
You start going over that.

748
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,318
Get graphics
working on tables, charts,
the whole nine yards.

749
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,230
Janine!

750
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,759
What's the angle,
five words?

751
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,360
Far left of center.

752
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,430
That's four.

753
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,510
Very far left of center.

754
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,000
Enough to put
Walker on his heels?

755
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,594
Fuck his heels.
This will put him on his ass.

756
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,430
What's up?

757
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,560
We've got a copy
of the administration's
education bill.

758
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,120
You're going to
work with Zoe,
do background copy.

759
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,793
Zoe Barnes?
Right here.

760
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,160
Whatever she needs.

761
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,196
Shouldn't I be
writing the...

762
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,310
She wrote it already.

763
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,359
And I want you to re-write
it, then re-write it again.
You'll help her.

764
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,160
Tom, I'm your chief
political correspondent.
Go.

765
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,310
I want this by tomorrow.

766
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,550
But I need to focus
on the inauguration.

767
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,915
This is more important.

768
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,153
Let's get started.

769
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,153
...<i>that I will
faithfully execute the office</i>

770
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,959
<i>of President of
the United States.</i>

771
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,555
<i>"...that I will faithfully
execute the office..."</i>

772
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,632
Power is a lot
like real estate.

773
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,832
It's all about location,
location, location.

774
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,559
The closer you
are to the source,

775
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,831
the higher your
property value.

776
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,430
Centuries from now,
when people
watch this footage,

777
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,437
who will they see
smiling just at
the edge of the frame?

778
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,479
<i>"So help me God."</i>

779
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,149
<i>Congratulations.</i>

780
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,271
<i>Today is not about
the next four years.</i>

781
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,275
<i>It's about
the next four decades.</i>

782
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,520
<i>You've placed
your faith in me,</i>

783
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,277
<i>and I, in turn,
choose to place that
faith in our children.</i>

784
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,317
<i>Our children
are the key to
this nation's future,</i>

785
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,715
<i>and that's why
the first order of business
for this administration</i>

786
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,396
<i>will be a comprehensive
education reform bill</i>

787
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,556
<i>to properly fix, finance
and strengthen our
nation's schools.</i>

788
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,717
<i>And I pledge to you,</i>

789
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,152
<i>we will have that bill
on the floor of the Congress</i>

790
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,790
<i>within the first 100 days
of this administration.</i>

791
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,237
It was so nice
of you to make this possible.

792
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,436
When you called
me, I was...

793
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,516
Not another word.

794
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,071
I'm going to miss
out on my ultimate
Frisbee league this season.

795
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,960
No, I'm serious.

796
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,077
A few of us on Budget
have quite a rivalry

797
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,237
going with
the guys on Finance.

798
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,670
It's fierce.
We get physical.

799
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,710
Anybody gets between
me and that goal line,
I will take that sucker down.

800
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,152
Donald, I've been looking
for you everywhere, maestro.

801
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,833
Yeah.
Let me help
you out there.

802
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,231
I really like
the work you've done
on the new draft.

803
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,755
It's a big step
forward. We're going to
make history together.

804
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,035
Thanks for your
encouragement, Francis.

805
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,157
Listen, I've got some
ideas about subsidies...

806
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,835
Catherine! Hold on to
that thought, Donald.

807
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,640
Don't you look stunning.

808
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,475
We Southern girls
clean up well

809
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,155
when we get out
of our Daisy Dukes
and into some Vera Wang.

810
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,517
And we Southern boys are
slow with our words,
but we're fast on our feet.

811
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,159
May I have the honor?

812
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,794
You most certainly may.

813
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,511
Morning, Freddy.
Mornin', Frank.

814
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,353
How's tricks?
Can't kick.

815
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,113
You want to go on in?
No, why don't you
set me up outside?

816
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,839
Outside?
It's freezing out here.

817
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,276
Well, a little cold
never hurt anybody.

818
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,070
Anything you
say, Frank.

819
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,599
It'll be right up.

820
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,431
My one guilty pleasure
is a good rack of ribs.
Even at 7:30 in the morning.

821
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,840
I have the whole
place to myself.

822
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,991
Freddy sometimes
opens up just for me.

823
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,192
Where I come from
in South Carolina,

824
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,590
people didn't have two
pennies to rub together.

825
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,349
A rack of ribs was
a luxury, like...

826
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,591
...Christmas in July.

827
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,879
This web traffic
is absolutely crazy.

828
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,391
...<i>blue Camry's
wanted in connection
to a canine hit-and-run.</i>

829
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,597
Hey, is this your car?

830
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,877
What's going on?

831
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,239
You want
seconds, Frank?

832
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,999
I better not.

833
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,192
Tell you what, Freddy.
Yes, I will.

834
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,912
I'm feeling hungry today.
